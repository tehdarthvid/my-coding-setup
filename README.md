# my coding setup

Just a bunch files to store/restore my coding setup.

## Fish Prompt

Modified the "Informative Vcs" fish promot just a bit but mainlytweaked the vcs info string to display icons and numbers the way I want.

### Installation

1. Place both files on `~/.config/fish/functions`.
1. If you already have a `fish_prompt.fish`, replace that with this.
